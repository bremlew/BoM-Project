        So, The Book of Mormon was written by Native Americans from Israel. How did they get there?
        The Book of Mormon starts with the story of a man named Lehi and his family. They left Jerusalem
        shortly before it was destroyed in 587 BC. They traveled to the ocean and built a boat that
        was blown by a storm to the American continent. When they arrived, they split into two opposing
        nations, the Nephites and the Lamanites, named after two of the sons of Lehi. These nations
        quickly became enemies, and spent a large part of their history attempting to destroy each other.
